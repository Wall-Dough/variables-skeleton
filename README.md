# variables-skeleton
Skeleton code for the Variables project!

SETUP

Step 1
Making a repository
Up in the top right-hand corner of GitHub is a plus sign. This is where you go to start a new repository. A repository is basically just a folder you can use to share your files with others. You'll want to build your repository to be ready for the web.

Click on the plus sign, and select New Repository. Type a short descriptive title (maybe "variables", but you can choose whatever you want) for the repository name, and provide a description if you'd like. It's not necessary. Keep the repository public. You'd have to upgrade your account to make it private.

Necessary Files
index.html - this is the main page of your site. If the user does not specify a file on your domain to access, this is the default. So for example, if someone goes to http://[your-username].github.io/experimental-variables/, they will be automatically directed to http://[your-username].github.io/experimental-variables/index.html.
code.js - you can really name this file anything you want, but I prefer code.js, because it's really the most descriptive. This is the JavaScript file, which is the meat of the project. A HTML page on its own is static. It will load the same every time, and doesn't change according to user input. Using JavaScript, you can allow an HTML page to be modified in real-time.
styles.css - this is what makes your page look pretty. Without this file, the page would just be a 12 pt. Times New Roman wall of text. Without it, you'd be better off making a Word document.

Those three files are really all you need. You can make a README file like this, to give people an idea of what your application does, but they will only be able to see the README file if you provide a link to the GitHub repository, which you may not want to do.
